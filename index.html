      <p class="w3-large">So, What is ComfyBot all about?</p>
      <p>According to a research brief published today by the World Health Organization (WHO), the prevalence of anxiety and sadness surged dramatically globally in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The executive summary also identifies those who have been most impacted and outlines how the epidemic has influenced access to mental health treatments and how this has changed over time. Therefore, our main objective is to offer a forum which is called ComfyBot where those who encountered that kind of situation may share with us what they are going through and what they want to talk about in order to overcome it. We think that through using ComfyBot, they will feel less depressed. Additionally, we kindly request that you help spread awareness of our application by telling those you know who are depressed or anxious.</p>
